##  Execute an Azure Function with triggers 

### What is a trigger?
A trigger is an object that defines a specific function. For example, if you want a function to execute every 10 minutes, you could use a timer trigger.

Every function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to execute a piece of logic that runs under multiple conditions, you need to create multiple functions that share the same core function code.

### Types of triggers
Azure Functions supports a wide range of trigger types. Here are some of the most common types:

### What is a binding?
A binding is a connection to data within your function.
- Optional
- Input binding (let's your function read data from another service)
- Output binding (let's your function write data to another service)
- Can have multiple bindings

### What is a function app?
Azure Functions lets you group one or more functions into a single function app. All functions in a function app share the same resources, app settings, and deployments.

### What is a timer trigger?
A timer trigger is a trigger that executes a function at a consistent interval. To create a timer trigger, you need to supply two pieces of information.

- A Timestamp parameter name, which is simply an identifier to access the trigger in code.
- A Schedule, which is a CRON expression that sets the interval for the timer.

Imagine you're a blog owner, and you notice that your subscribers aren't reading your most recent posts. You decide that the best action is to send an email once a week to remind them to check your blog. You implement this logic by creating a function app in Azure with a timer trigger to invoke your function weekly.

### What is an HTTP trigger?
An HTTP trigger is a trigger that executes code when it receives an HTTP request. HTTP triggers have many capabilities and customizations, including:

- Providing authorized access by supplying keys.
- Restricting which HTTP verbs are supported.
- Returning data back to the caller.
- Receiving data through query string parameters or through the request body.
- Supporting URL route templates to modify the function URL.

When you create an HTTP trigger, you need to provide a name for the trigger and choose an Authorization level.

### What is an HTTP trigger Authorization level?
An HTTP trigger Authorization level is a flag that indicates whether an incoming HTTP request needs an API key for authorization.

There are three Authorization levels:
- Function
- Anonymous
- Admin

The Function and Admin levels are "key" based. To send an HTTP request, you must supply a key for authorization. 
There are two types of keys: function and host. The difference between the two keys is their scope. Function keys are specific to a function. Host keys apply to all functions inside the function app. If your Authorization level is set to Function, you can use either a function or a host key. If your Authorization level is set to Admin, you must supply a host key.

### What is Azure Storage?
Azure Storage is Microsoft's cloud storage solution that supports all types of data, including: blobs, queues, and NoSQL. The goal of Azure Storage is to provide data storage that's:
- Highly available
- Secure
- Scalable
- Managed

### What is Azure Blob storage?
Azure Blob storage is an object-storage solution that's designed to store large amounts of unstructured data.

For example, Azure Blob storage is great at doing things like:
- Storing files
- Serving files
- Streaming video and audio
- Logging data

There are three types of blobs: block blobs, append blobs, and page blobs. 
- Block blobs are the most common type. They allow you to store text or binary data efficiently.
- Append blobs are like block blobs, but they're designed more for append operations like creating a log file that's being constantly updated. 
- Page blobs are made up of pages and are designed for frequent random read and write operations.

### What is a blob trigger?
A blob trigger is a trigger that executes a function when you upload or update a file in Azure Blob storage. Functions periodically checks a storage container for changes, which can result in some latency. There are ways to reduce this latency when triggering on blob containers.

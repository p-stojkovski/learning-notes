### The Software Architect's Elevator

The problem:
Gathering bussiness requirments, the architect need to have a lot of dissusions with bussiness people, from bussniess leaders to junior developers. The danger is if you spend too much time with higher level people in the hierarcy, you run the risk of becoming higher level architect, the one who mandating with builing things, distributing architecture decisions, just telling people what to do without understanding what's really happening on the ground, how the sistem is being build.

But, if you spent too much time on the ground, you can lose that perspective of the bigger picture and strategic directions that the bussiness is taking.

Solution: **The Software Architects Elevator**

Must understand the problem that system is solving.

### The importance of the bussiness context

It's very important to understand the bussiness context and translate to technical desing.

Very important conversation flow when talking to bussiness person and gathering information:
1. What is the primary purpose of the system?
2. Dive deeper into the business context, the use case!
3. More business ontext... It's important!
4. Clarify understanding!
5. How critical is the component? What happens if it isn't working?
6. How does the component fit into the wider business landscape?
7. What is expected load?
8. Are there any plans for that load to grow?
9. Any other integration (sytems) required?

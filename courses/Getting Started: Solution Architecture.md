### The Software Architect's Elevator

The problem:
Gathering bussiness requirments, the architect need to have a lot of dissusions with bussiness people, from bussniess leaders to junior developers. The danger is if you spend too much time with higher level people in the hierarcy, you run the risk of becoming higher level architect, the one who mandating with builing things, distributing architecture decisions, just telling people what to do without understanding what's really happening on the ground, how the sistem is being build.

### Common business issues

Business processes modeled in software are often called workflows. Azure includes four different technologies that you can use to build and implement workflows that integrate multiple systems:

- Logic Apps
- Microsoft Power Automate
- WebJobs
- Azure Functions

#### Logic Apps
Logic Apps is a service within Azure to automate, orchestrate, and integrate disparate components of a distributed application.

So, let's say you want to automate sending an email whenever someone fills out a form on your website. You can use Azure Logic Apps to connect your form app to your email app. Then, whenever someone submits the form, the Logic App will automatically send an email without you having to do anything. You have different tasks you want to do on your computer, like sending an email when a new file appears in a folder, or posting a tweet when someone fills out a form. Instead of doing each of these tasks manually, Azure Logic Apps lets you create a set of instructions, like a recipe, for your computer to follow.

These instructions are called workflows, and they're made up of different steps, like mixing ingredients in a recipe. With Azure Logic Apps, you can connect different apps and services together, like Lego blocks, to build these workflows.

#### Microsoft Power Automate
Microsoft Power Automate is a service to create workflows even when you have no development or IT Pro experience.

There are four different types of flow that you can create:

- Automated: Starts by a trigger from some event. For example, the event could be the arrival of a new short post or a new file being uploaded.
- Button: Runs a repetitive task with a single click from your mobile device.
- Scheduled: Runs regularly. For example, once a week, on a specific date, or after 10 hours.
- Business process: Models a business process such as the stock ordering process or the complaints procedure. The flow process can have: notifications to required people; with their approval recorded; calendar dates for steps; and recorded time of flow steps.

Here's the deal: Power Automate helps you automate tasks on your computer without needing to do them yourself. It's like having a digital assistant that follows your instructions to get stuff done.

So, how does it work? Well, you create what's called a "flow," which is basically a set of instructions for the computer to follow. These instructions tell the computer what to do when certain things happen, like when you receive an email or when a file is added to a folder.

# Datadog Fundamentals

### Notes on Infrastructure and Application Monitoring with Datadog

**1. Key Aspects of Monitoring:**
   - **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Tracks server performance, availability, and resource usage (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage).
      - These are recorded as **metrics** that represent measurements over time, like CPU utilization percentage or errors per minute.
   - **Application Performance Monitoring**: Provides an overview of the entire system, combining both infrastructure and application metrics.

**2. Features Needed in a Monitoring Solution:**
   - **Cloud-Based Service**: Allows Globomantics to focus on their work without setting up additional systems.
   - **Flexible Data Collection**: Should easily gather data from various resources like servers, databases, and containers.
   - **Filtering Capabilities**: Should allow tagging and filtering of metrics for targeted analysis.
   - **Visualization**: Supports creating dashboards, graphs, and other visuals to help analyze data.
   - **Alerts and Notifications**: Provides timely notifications for issues via email, text, or other channels.

**3. Why Datadog?**
   - Datadog offers the flexibility, visualization, and alert capabilities Globomantics needs for efficient, global monitoring.

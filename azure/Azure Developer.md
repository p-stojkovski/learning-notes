### Common business issues

Business processes modeled in software are often called workflows. Azure includes four different technologies that you can use to build and implement workflows that integrate multiple systems:

- Logic Apps
- Microsoft Power Automate
- WebJobs
- Azure Functions

#### Logic Apps
Logic Apps is a service within Azure to automate, orchestrate, and integrate disparate components of a distributed application.

So, let's say you want to automate sending an email whenever someone fills out a form on your website. You can use Azure Logic Apps to connect your form app to your email app. Then, whenever someone submits the form, the Logic App will automatically send an email without you having to do anything. You have different tasks you want to do on your computer, like sending an email when a new file appears in a folder, or posting a tweet when someone fills out a form. Instead of doing each of these tasks manually, Azure Logic Apps lets you create a set of instructions, like a recipe, for your computer to follow.

These instructions are called workflows, and they're made up of different steps, like mixing ingredients in a recipe. With Azure Logic Apps, you can connect different apps and services together, like Lego blocks, to build these workflows.
